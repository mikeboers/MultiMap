MultiMap
========

Provides a set of ordered mapping objects which allow for multiple values per key. The defining quality of this project vs others is that values mapped by the same key are not ordered together. Eg. you can have objects mapped to by the same key located at both the front and the back of the natural order of the mapping.

`MultiMap` and `MutableMultiMap` also export an interface that allows them to substitute for other popular multi-keyed or ordered mappings.

Please see the docstrings for API examples.
